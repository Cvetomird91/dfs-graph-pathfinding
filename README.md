This is a Graph pathfinding project I wrote for my Artificial Intelligence studies in Plovdiv University.

It uses DFS algorithm to find the possible routes in between the nodes.

The data about the nodes is stored in src/resources/nodes.grf and src/resources/links.grf. It's read in Graph::readData method when the Graph is initialized.
